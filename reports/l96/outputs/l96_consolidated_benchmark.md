# L96 Consolidated Benchmark — DA baselines vs neural models

Setup: two-scale L96, Obs30 (`obs_interval=100`, `obs_j=2` → 24D observed space), dws=500, 200 shared cached test windows; S1 = ±20% params + ±10% bias (DA forward model uses biased `*_da`).

RMSE/EV are recomputed from the stored trajectory arrays via `evaluation/estimate_metrics.py`; ES for DA ensemble methods (EnKF/ETKF) and L3 (ens30×10) are proper ensemble scores (N=30, MAE − 0.5·pairwise spread) read from cached run outputs; ES for deterministic methods is the N=1 per-dim MAE proxy. **bold** marks the best value per column.

## Benchmarked schemes

| ID | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Strong-4DVar | Variational | Strong-constraint 4D-Var over the dws=500 window (`B_var=2.0`, `R_var=0.5`, `max_iter=10`, `lr=0.2`, autodiff minimization); assimilates the full window trajectory. |
| EnKF | Ensemble KF | Stochastic ensemble Kalman filter, `N_ens=30`, inflation=2.0, no localization; sequential observation updates. |
| ETKF | Ensemble KF | Deterministic ensemble square-root filter, `N_ens=30`, inflation=2.0, no localization. |
| L1b | Neural (DirectUNet) | Single-pass regression obs → state, hidden [64,128,256]; obs-only conditioning; 200 epochs. |
| L2b | Neural (CFM, τ=0) | Conditional flow matching trained at τ=0 only; sampled with a single Euler step (deterministic, conditional-mean-like); hidden [64,128,256]; 400 epochs. |
| L3 | Neural (CFM, multi-τ) | Standard multi-τ CFM training; evaluated as a 30-member ensemble with 10 Euler steps (`ens30×10`, N=30, deterministic τ-schedule 0→1, fresh x₀ per member); hidden [64,128,256]; 400 epochs. |
| L4 | Neural (DirectUNet) | As L1b with small backbone [32,64,128]. |
| L5 | Neural (CFM, τ=0) | As L2b with small backbone [32,64,128]. |
| L6 | Neural (CFM, τ=0) | As L2b plus corrupted-forcing conditioning (`cond_extra_dim=1`); tests the robustness value of forcing input. |
| V2 | Neural (TweedieCFM) | Two-stage Tweedie CFM: stage-1 MeanEstimatorCell (obs → mean), stage-2 residual velocity UNet; hidden [64,128,256]; 100+400 epochs; multi-τ, **K_inner=1 (kinner1 variant)**; evaluated as a 30-member ensemble with 10 Euler steps (`ens30×10`, N=30); N_outer=10. The V2 row reports the **K_inner=1 ablation** (see the dedicated `l96_tweediecfm_benchmark.md` for the full V2 family). |
| V3 | Neural (PredictStateCFM) | Single-stage CFM predicting the final-state mean μ = E[x₁|x_τ,y]; hidden [64,128,256]; 400 epochs; evaluated as a 30-member ensemble with 10 Euler steps (`ens30×10`, N=30); N_outer=10. |
| SDA1 | Neural (SDA prior + DPS guidance) | Unconditional flow-matching prior p(x₁) -- no obs, params, or forcing conditioning at all, trained on the same S0/S1 mix (`forcing_state_bias=0.1` in train/val, same as every other L-series/V2/V3 config); hidden [64,128,256]; 400 epochs. State estimated at inference time only, via DPS/Pi-GDM-style observation guidance (normalized-gradient step on the Tweedie posterior-mean estimate, `evaluation/sda_sampler.py`) with N_outer=10 Euler steps, guidance_weight=40 (picked by an S0 RMSE sweep over {0.3..400}), R_var=0.5 (matches `data.R_var`); evaluated as a 30-member ensemble (fresh x₀ per member, `ens30×10`, N=30), same convention as L3/V2/V3. |
| SDA2-mixed | Neural (SDA prior, params+forcing cond. + DPS guidance) | As SDA1 but the prior is additionally conditioned on the per-window physical params (F, c1, hx, eps, w1-w4) and the corrupted forcing signal (`ConditionalPriorCFM`, `models/sda.py`) -- obs is still never a network input, only the guidance term at inference conditions on it. Trained on the identical S0/S1 mix as SDA1 (`forcing_state_bias=0.1`); hidden [64,128,256]; 400 epochs; guidance_weight=40, N_outer=10, R_var=0.5; evaluated as a 30-member ensemble (`ens30×10`, N=30). |
| SDA2-nominal | Neural (SDA prior, params+forcing cond., nominal-only train) | Identical architecture/inference to SDA2-mixed but trained with `forcing_state_bias=0.0` (genuinely nominal-only train/val -- never sees the S1-level forcing corruption at training time, unlike every other row in this table); hidden [64,128,256]; 400 epochs; guidance_weight=40, N_outer=10, R_var=0.5; evaluated as a 30-member ensemble (`ens30×10`, N=30). Tests whether the amortized S1/S0 resilience seen elsewhere in this table survives when training-time exposure to model error is removed entirely. |
| FDV1 | Neural (4DVarNet-style unrolled solver) | Unrolled solver: the update at each of N_outer=10 iterations is the output of a weight-tied UNet1D fed `concat(state, obs)` (`update_input='obs+state'`, no gradient/cost term at all -- see `models/fourdvarnet.py::FourDVarNetSolver`), `x_{k+1} = x_k - (1/N_outer)*UNet(x_k, obs)`, zero-initialized; hidden [64,128,256]; 400 epochs; loss = final-iteration MSE only. Fully deterministic (no ensemble, no randomness anywhere) -- evaluated as a single pass (N=1), same convention as Strong-4DVar/L1b/L2b. Design taxonomy (`update_input` string) traced to CIA-Oceanix/4dvarnet-global-mapping's `ronan_devs` branch (`GradSolver_withStep`); gradient-conditioned modes (`grad-only`/`grad+state`/`subgrad+state`) reserved for a future FDV2. |
| FDV1CFM | Neural (4DVarNet-CFM, PredictStateCFM + FDV1 backbone) | V3 (`PredictStateCFM`) CFM parameterization -- predicts μ = E[x1|x_τ,y] at a randomly-sampled outer flow-time τ, trained via MSE(μ,x1), sampled by forward ODE integration `x += dt*(μ-x)/(1-τ)` over N_outer=10 steps -- but μ is computed by FDV1's own K_inner=5-step weight-tied unrolled `obs+state` refinement (`models/fourdvarnet.py::FourDVarNetPredictStateCFM`), started from the current x_τ, instead of a single UNet1D forward pass as plain V3 uses. Total NFE per sample = N_outer×K_inner = 50 (5x V3's 10, 5x FDV1's 10). hidden [64,128,256]; 400 epochs, single random τ per training batch (cheaper to train than FDV1 itself, which backprops through its full 10-step unroll every batch). A rare (~1-in-several-thousand ens30 samples) divergence of the inner unroll on out-of-distribution x_τ is guarded with a `clip_range=50.0` clamp after each inner step (same convention as this codebase's L96/QG dynamics integrators) -- inactive for in-distribution trajectories (|x|<10). Evaluated as a 30-member ensemble with 10 Euler steps (`ens30×10`, N=30). |
| FDV1+SDA1 | Neural (FDV1 mean + SDA1 warm-started guidance) | No retraining: FDV1's frozen point estimate warm-starts SDA1's guided sampling trajectory (`evaluation/sda_sampler.py`'s `mean_estimate`/`tau0`, a "SDEdit"-style warm start -- `x_τ0 = (1-τ0)·noise + τ0·FDV1_estimate`, Euler-integrated only from τ0 to 1) instead of starting from pure noise; `guided_obs_cost`/the Tweedie x_hat_1 machinery are unchanged. Hyperparameters (`tau0=0.7`, `guidance_weight=2`) picked by an S0-only grid sweep over `tau0∈{0,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.8}×guidance_weight∈{0,1,2,5,10,40,100}` -- any guidance stronger than ~2 actively hurts once warm-started (the DPS step size calibrated for pure-noise starts is too aggressive here); evaluated as a 30-member ensemble (`ens30×10`, N=30). |
| FDV1+SDA2 | Neural (FDV1 mean + SDA2-nominal warm-started guidance) | As FDV1+SDA1 but warm-starting SDA2-nominal (params+forcing-conditioned prior) instead of SDA1; `tau0=0.5`, `guidance_weight=2` (own S0-only grid sweep -- SDA2's conditioning makes more remaining Euler steps useful than SDA1's fully-unconditional prior, hence the lower `tau0`); evaluated as a 30-member ensemble (`ens30×10`, N=30). **New best neural scheme in this table on RMSE/EV** (FDV1CFM above still has the best ES). |
| FDV1+FDV1CFM | Neural (FDV1 mean + FDV1-CFM warm-started sampling) | No retraining: FDV1's frozen point estimate warm-starts FDV1-CFM's own sampling trajectory via the same `mean_estimate`/`tau0` SDEdit-style mechanism as the FDV1+SDA hybrids (`models/fourdvarnet.py::FourDVarNetPredictStateCFM.sample`) -- `x_τ0 = (1-τ0)·noise + τ0·FDV1_estimate`, Euler-integrated only from τ0 to 1. A literal τ0=0 warm start (recentering the τ=0 noise on FDV1's estimate, still running the full N_outer steps) was tried first and made things *worse* (single-sample RMSE 0.897 vs. 0.555 unwarm-started): CFM training pairs τ=0 with near-zero-magnitude noise only, so injecting a real-state-scale mean there is an out-of-training-distribution (τ, |x_τ|) combination that confuses the first refinement step, and that confusion compounds since no steps are skipped. `tau0=0.7` (picked by an S0-only sweep over `tau0∈{0,0.2,...,0.9}`, single-sample RMSE, plateauing over `tau0∈[0.6,0.8]`) avoids this the same way the FDV1+SDA hybrids do. Evaluated as a 30-member ensemble (`ens30×10`, N=30); no clamp activations observed in this evaluation (unlike FDV1CFM alone) since the shorter, better-anchored trajectory has much less room to diverge. |

Shared setup: all L-series neural models are trained and evaluated on the identical DA-parity benchmark (all-5 params ±20% randomized per window; S1 adds a ±10% bias; models operate in the 24D observed subspace with obs-only inputs unless noted). DA baselines receive the same per-window parameters as the truth generation (S0) or their biased `*_da` counterparts (S1), which is what makes the DA-vs-neural comparison apples-to-apples.

Note on conventions: the DA metric cache stores the **mean of per-window RMSEs** (evaluation/run_l96.py), while this table uses the **pooled** convention (`sqrt(mean sq err)` over all windows/timesteps) for every method — the same convention as the neural evaluation. Pooled RMSE is ≤ mean-of-window RMSE, so DA values here are slightly lower (more favorable) than in the legacy cache; both orderings agree.

`*` = ES from a one-member ensemble (N=1, deterministic; ES = per-dim MAE). Unmarked = proper ensemble ES (N=30, MAE − 0.5·pairwise spread). EnKF/ETKF ES are read from the bug-fixed DA cache; L3 ES from the ens30×10 run; Strong-4DVar and other neural models are deterministic (N=1).

## Consistency checks

- DA cached metrics vs recomputed-from-npz (42 values): max |Δ| = 2.16e-04 → PASS
- Neural stored truth vs dataset true_state[:, obs_var_indices]: max |Δ| = 0.00e+00 → PASS

## Reconstruction examples (Hovmöller)

Windows ranked by per-window pooled 24D RMSE of Strong-4DVar (best DA scheme); each figure shows rows = Truth/methods and columns = state / |error| maps for the slow X (8D) and fast Y (16D) blocks. State colors share one scale per figure; error maps share one scale across all rows/methods (99.5th-percentile cap, noted on the colorbar). Dotted vertical lines on the truth row mark observation times.
