    and feeding that directly into a plain UNet1D is numerically fragile over

    ``cache``/``key`` (both optional) reproduce the *caching* granularity
    ocean4dvarnet also uses: the norm is computed once, on the first call for
    a given ``key`` within one unrolled solve, then reused unchanged for
    every subsequent iteration of that same solve (``ConvLstmGradModel``'s
    own ``self._grad_norm``, reset via ``reset_state`` once per batch). The
    caller (``FourDVarNetSolver.forward``/``FourDVarNetPredictStateCFM.forward``)
    creates a fresh ``{}`` once per ``forward()`` call (one call = one
    complete unrolled solve). Without a cache (``cache=None``, e.g. the unit
    tests that call this directly), the norm is just computed fresh every
    call.

    The norm is detached (a stop-gradient scale factor) so the normalized
    tensor stays fully differentiable w.r.t. upstream parameters (via the
    un-normalized numerator) without backpropagating through the norm
    computation itself.

    Deliberately computes ``norm`` unconditionally (even on a cache hit,

    rather than branching on ``key in cache`` to skip the computation: each
    call site is wrapped in ``torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint`` (see

    recomputation (during backward) to perform the *exact* same ops as its

    would make the very first iteration's checkpoint recompute (which always
    lands after the whole unrolled solve has already populated the cache)
    diverge from that same iteration's original forward (a cache miss at the
    time it first ran), raising ``torch.utils.checkpoint.CheckpointError:
    ... different number of tensors was saved``. Unconditional computation
    keeps the op sequence identical regardless of cache state; the discarded
    norm is detached and unused, so this changes no gradient, only adds one

    (unlike SDA's inference-only guidance) because here the OUTER training

    "subgrad+state" (ported from ronan_devs' ``GradSolver_withStep``) never
    calls autograd -- it's a cheap two-residual proxy: the raw observation
    residual ``obs - x`` and the prior-autoencoder reconstruction residual
    ``x - Phi(x)`` (the standard denoising-residual approximation of
    ``prior_cost``'s true gradient, valid when treating ``Phi(x)`` as locally
    constant), concatenated with ``x``. Cheaper per iteration (plain
    forward-mode tensor ops only) while remaining fully backpropagable
    through ``prior_unet``'s parameters via ordinary autograd.

    Simplification vs. the ronan_devs port: that implementation adds an extra
    ``lr_grad``-weighted raw-gradient term to the *outer* state update
    whenever the Python substring check ``'grad' in input_grad_update`` is
    true -- which (read literally) also matches ``"subgrad+state"`` (since
    ``"subgrad"`` contains ``"grad"``), a likely-unintentional legacy quirk.
    This port keeps the three gradient-conditioned modes fully separate (no
    such cross-talk) and does not add any extra outer-loop term at all --
    only what feeds the main UNet changes per mode; the existing
    ``x - (1/N)*gmod`` update rule (shared with "obs+state"/"obs-only") is

    of a UNet fed a mode-dependent input built from the current state,
    observations, and/or a variational-cost (sub)gradient, run for a fixed
    number of iterations.

    ``update_input`` selects what the update block sees each iteration,
    matching the config-string taxonomy explored on
    CIA-Oceanix/4dvarnet-global-mapping's ``ronan_devs`` branch
    (``GradSolver_withStep``'s ``input_grad_update``):

    - ``"obs+state"`` (default): ``concat(state, obs)``, no cost function at
      all -- the original FDV1 variant.
    - ``"obs-only"``: just the observations, no state feedback.
    - ``"grad-only"``/``"grad+state"``: the real autograd gradient of
      ``prior_cost(state) + obs_weight*obs_cost(state, obs)`` w.r.t. state
      (ported from ``ocean4dvarnet``'s ``GradSolver``), alone or concatenated
      with state. See ``_build_update_input``.
    - ``"subgrad+state"``: a cheap two-residual proxy gradient (obs residual +
      prior-autoencoder residual), concatenated with state, no autograd call.

    The gradient-conditioned modes need a trainable prior operator
    (``self.prior_unet``, a second ``UNet1D`` sharing the main UNet's
    ``hidden_channels``/``time_emb_dim``/``dropout`` -- mirrors
    ``TweedieCFM``'s ``mean_estimator``/``velocity_unet`` hyperparameter
    sharing), constructed only when ``update_input`` needs it so
    ``"obs+state"``/``"obs-only"`` checkpoints stay exactly as before (no
    dead weights).

    Unlike ``"obs+state"``/``"obs-only"`` (a bounded-by-construction update,
    empirically stable throughout FDV1's own training -- no clamp was ever
    needed there), the gradient-conditioned modes couple ``x`` into a
    variational cost whose gradient feeds back into the next iteration's
    input, repeated ``N_outer`` times with no bound -- exactly the kind of
    loop that made ``FourDVarNetPredictStateCFM`` diverge during its own
    training (see that class's docstring) before it gained a ``clip_range``
    clamp. ``FourDVarNetSolver`` lacked the same clamp entirely (only
    ``FourDVarNetPredictStateCFM`` had one) until a "grad+state" FDV1
    (deterministic) training run never trained at all -- stuck flat from
    epoch 0, unlike the CFM variant, which trained normally for hundreds of
    epochs before eventually diverging. Clamping ``x`` to
    ``[-clip_range, clip_range]`` after each iteration (same convention as
    ``models/lorenz96_dynamics.py``, ``evaluation/baselines.py``, and
    ``FourDVarNetPredictStateCFM`` itself) closes this gap; inactive for

        single-hop gradient path to the loss, instead of relying solely on
        the 10-deep chained double-backward through

        count-independent, see ``_masked_obs_cost``'s docstring), but at
        realistic batch/window sizes that sum is ~4-5 orders of magnitude
        larger than the MSE term above (empirically: MSE~1.0 vs. raw
        var_cost~1e4-1e5 at B=32,T=300,D=24). Divide by ``B*T*D`` here --
        for this *outer* auxiliary term only -- so ``aux_var_cost_weight``

    """V3 (``PredictStateCFM``) CFM parameterization -- predicts
    ``mu = E[x1|x_tau,y]`` at each outer flow-time ``tau``, trained via
    ``MSE(mu, x1)`` and sampled by forward ODE integration
    ``x += dt*(mu-x)/(1-tau)`` -- but ``mu`` is computed by ``FourDVarNetSolver``'s
    own weight-tied unrolled refinement (``K_inner`` steps, mode selected by
    ``update_input`` -- see ``FourDVarNetSolver``/``_build_update_input`` for
    the full taxonomy), started from the current ``x_tau``, instead of a
    single ``UNet1D`` forward pass as plain ``PredictStateCFM`` uses.

    Deliberately does NOT compose via a nested ``FourDVarNetSolver`` instance:
    that would produce checkpoint keys like ``model.solver.unet....``, breaking
    ``evaluation/neural_inference.py``'s checkpoint-introspection (hardcoded to
    the flat ``model.unet....``/``model.velocity_unet....`` names every other
    model in this codebase uses). Instead this class owns flat ``self.unet``/
    ``self.prior_unet`` submodules and re-implements ``FourDVarNetSolver``'s
    loop body and ``_build_update_input`` dispatch inline -- if that update
    rule changes, mirror the change here too.

    The inner ``K_inner`` refinement uses its own ``k/(K_inner-1)`` iteration-
    index embedding, independent of the outer CFM ``tau`` (a documented
    simplification, not an oversight) -- ``tau`` is accepted by ``forward``
    only for interface parity with ``VanillaCFM``/``PredictStateCFM``.

    Unlike ``FourDVarNetSolver`` (zero-initialized, deterministic), ``forward``
    here is called on an arbitrary ``x_t`` -- during sampling this can start
    far from the data manifold (fresh Gaussian noise at early outer ``tau``),
    and occasionally (~1 in a few thousand full ``ens30`` samples, empirically)
    the ``K_inner``-step unrolled refinement diverges within a handful of
    steps: an out-of-distribution ``x`` produces a large UNet update, which
    produces an even-more-out-of-distribution ``x`` on the next inner
    iteration. A single such outlier member is enough to blow up the
    ensemble-mean point estimate (though not the ensemble scoring rule (ES),
    which is comparatively robust to one bad member). Guarded the same way
    every other L96 state-space integrator in this codebase guards against
    unbounded divergence (``models/lorenz96_dynamics.py``,
    ``evaluation/baselines.py``): clamp ``x`` to ``[-clip_range, clip_range]``
    after each inner update. ``clip_range=50.0`` matches those call sites'
    default and is >5x the observed in-distribution state range (|x|<10),
    so this is inactive for every normal trajectory and only bounds the rare
    divergent one.

        (same mechanism and naming as ``evaluation/sda_sampler.py``'s
        ``sda_guided_sample``): instead of starting the trajectory from pure
        noise at tau=0, start from ``interpolant.mix(noise, mean_estimate,
        tau0)`` at ``tau0`` and only run the Euler loop from there to tau=1
        (fewer steps -- cheaper NFE too). ``tau0`` is snapped to the existing
        ``step/N_outer`` discretization (``step0 = round(tau0*N_outer)``) so
        the warm-started point lands on a training-time-valid interpolant
        point.

        A naive version of this warm start that instead set ``x_0 =
        mean_estimate + noise`` *at* tau=0 (running the full ``N_outer``-step
        trajectory, no steps skipped) was tried and empirically made things
        *worse* than no warm start at all (measured RMSE 0.897 vs. 0.555 for
        a single unwarm-started sample, on the canonical S0 test set): CFM
        training pairs tau=0 with near-zero-magnitude noise only (``x0 =
        randn*sigma_prior``), so injecting a real-state-scale ``mean_estimate``
        there is an out-of-training-distribution (tau, |x_tau|) combination
        that confuses rather than helps the first refinement step -- and that
        confusion compounds since no steps are skipped. Warm-starting at an
        intermediate ``tau0`` (this implementation) avoids this exactly the
        way the FDV1+SDA hybrid already does, since the interpolant's blend at
        ``tau0>0`` is consistent with what the network saw in training at
        that ``tau0``.
