# 4DVarNet-FM: Implementation Plan

## Overview

Three model families + CS3/CS4 randomized-parameter tests + Experiment G ablation.

- **DirectUNet**: Single UNet pass `obs → state` via MSE (no flow matching) — implemented
- **VanillaCFM**: Standard conditional flow matching, no Tweedie decomposition — implemented
- **TweedieSolver**: Original two-stage solver — legacy, maintained
- **RandomParamDataset**: Per-window randomized `σ,ρ,β` ±20% for robust training — implemented
- **CS3/CS4**: Evaluation on unseen random parameter draws — implemented
- **Exp G (τ=0 CFM)**: Ablate multi-τ training to isolate CFM's source of advantage — implemented (L63; τ=0 runs superseded by the S-series, also L63)

**System naming convention:** the E/F/G/S experiment series are all **Lorenz-63**
(`train_mix: cs1+cs2`, `state_dim=3` checkpoints). The **L-series** is the two-scale
**Lorenz-96** benchmark (`system: lorenz96`, `state_dim=24` observed subspace).

## QG (two-layer quasi-geostrophic) — integrated to master 2026-09-02

DA-baseline case study on a two-layer Phillips channel (pyqg-compatible), now with
the **full executable codebase integrated to master** (previously only the JSON-only
report + generator were on master).

- **Dynamics**: `models/qg_dynamics.py` (`QGDynamics`, 2-layer) + `models/qg1l_dynamics.py`
  (`QG1LDynamics`, reduced-gravity 1-layer structural-error model) + `models/qg_interp.py`
  (spectral resize). Native torch port of pyqg v0.4.0 (RK4, flux-form advection, pyqg
  exponential filter, masked PV inversion), moving-storm wind-stress curl forcing.
- **Data**: `data/qg.py` (`QGConfig`, `QGDataset`, `make_qg_s0_s1_datasets`) — S0/S1
  along-track + random-column obs, corrupted wind/param bias, qg1l structural-error scenario.
  **Random-column geometry (2026-09-05):** `cols_per_day` distinct meridional columns are now
  each observed exactly once per day at its **own** randomly-sampled intra-day step (no two
  columns of a day share a step) — `obs (T,ny)`, `obs_columns (T,)`, `OBS_GEOMETRY_VERSION=2`
  folded into the truth-cache key so a geometry change auto-invalidates old obs caches.
  DA re-run vs the old single-simultaneous-event-per-day constellation: S0 cols=8/lag 1.0
  clearly improves (RMSE −7.7%, EV +0.777→+0.812), cols=4 essentially unchanged; S1 da_nx
  32/64 slightly degrades (RMSE +6–7%, EV −9 to −12 pts) since dispersing the simultaneous
  multi-column updates reduces each update's spatial info under model error.
- **DA baselines**: `evaluation/run_qg_baselines.py` (+ `eval_qg1l_rscale_probe.py`,
  `sweep_qg_baselines.py`) drive EnKF/ETKF on ψ/q. `evaluation/baselines.py` carries the
  shared `ObsOperator` H-mode, `_build_qg_loc_matrices`/`_build_qg_col_loc_matrices`,
  and per-time `loc_Lx_t`/`loc_Ly_t` localization + `init_ensemble` in ETKF/EnKF, merged
  with the L96/joint/ES work.
- **Psi-state variant**: `models/qg_psi_dynamics.py` (`QGPsiDynamics`/`QG1LPsiDynamics`,
  `wrap_psi`) integrates with the **streamfunction as the state variable**, so the psi
  observation operator reduces to a trivial index lookup (`obs_var="psi_state"`). The
  q-space physics is bit-identical to the q-state model (windows around the same
  `_rk4_step`/filter/clip), so free forecasts match to ~1e-6 relative and ETKF skill is
  comparable to the legacy H-function psi-obs. Works for same-resolution S0 + full-res
  qg1l. **Cross-resolution S1 (da_nx 32/16) is now supported** (2026-09-03) via an H-mode
  psi obs operator (`_psi_h` spectrally upsamples the DA-model psi-state to the obs grid
  before column selection); same-res behavior is bit-identical (re-verified EV −2.925).
  **Caveat:** psi_state DA gives a skilful **streamfunction** analysis (psi full EV +0.59
  at da_nx=32) but a degenerate **PV (q) field** (q full EV −3.2 vs the q-state da_nx=32
  ref +0.34): `forward_pv` (q ≈ ∇²ψ) amplifies high-wavenumber psi-analysis error by K²,
  so the q-field skill score (which `expvar_full` reports) collapses while the psi field
  itself is well-estimated. This is a physical psi↔q representation limitation, not a code
  bug (free forecasts still match exactly). On S0 at the q-state-matching noise 0.01 the
  psi-state q-field EV is 0.583 (q1 0.76 / q2 0.40) vs the q-state+psi-obs 0.752 (0.82/0.69),
  while psi-state's streamfunction fields are the best per-field (psi1/psi2 ≈ 0.98); at
  default 0.05 noise the S0 psi-state qall is 0.487 vs the q-state 0.660.
  **Decision (2026-09-03): q-state is the default DA config** — recorded in the dedicated
  report (`reports/qg/generate_qg_psi_state_report.py` → `qg_psi_state_report.md`) and in
  the `--obs-var` default (`'q'`) / help text of `run_qg_baselines.py` and
  `sweep_qg_baselines.py`. psi_state/psi remain research alternatives.
- **Reference-case DA benchmark (2026-09):** `QG4DVar` (strong- and weak-constraint; psi-obs H
  with absolute time index, whitened control, Adam/LBFGS) added to `run_qg_baselines.py`, plus
  dedicated EnKF/Strong/Weak-4DVar reference runs. At the reference case (S0, c4, psi-obs,
  nx=64, 1% noise, N=80, loc 6.0, lags 1.0/2.0) the report's §4.1 now lists **all four** DA
  methods: ETKF/EnKF (≈1.16/0.75 lag1, ≈1.61/0.65 lag2), Strong-4DVar (LBFGS w=60: 1.33/0.725
  lag1, 1.43/0.322 lag2), and **Weak-4DVar** (LBFGS w60 q=0.1: **lag1 1.43/0.788 — best lag-1.0
  row**, lag2 1.44/0.370). Weak uses per-step model-error controls
  `q_t = dyn(q_{t-1}) + Lq·u_t`, `Jq = 0.5Σu[1:]²`; LBFGS over 5-day windows + `q_var_scale=0.1`
  is the robust config (Adam diverges, q<0.1 under-fits, q=1.0 drops below free forecast).
  **S1 (2026-09-05, job 52087):** Weak-4DVar at da_nx=64 (nores) beats the ETKF reference on the
  S1 model-error case — §5.6: improv **1.92**/EV 0.398 (lag1) and 1.64/EV 0.023 (lag2) vs ETKF
  1.55/0.428 (lag1) — the per-step model-error controls absorb the S1 param/wind bias.
  **S1 extension, cross-res + QG1L (2026-09-06, `feature/qg-da-integration`):**
  - *S1-cross-res* (`da_nx=32` vs truth `nx=64`, param+wind bias on top of the resolution
    mismatch): ETKF/EnKF 1.47x-1.48x/0.34; Strong-4DVar 1.25x/-0.94; Weak-4DVar 1.39x/**-0.23**.
    Same pattern as S1-no-res, more pronounced: Weak-4DVar clearly beats Strong-4DVar but
    neither yet matches ETKF/EnKF here — cross-resolution adds its own difficulty on top of
    the bias effect. Open follow-up: tune Weak-4DVar's `b_var_scale`/`q_var_scale`
    specifically for the cross-res case (only the S1-no-res values have been tried).
  - *S1-QG1L* (structural error, full-res 1-layer DA model) — **the scenario itself is
    broken for every method at these settings, not a 4DVar-specific bug**: ETKF gets
    EV=-11.2, EnKF gets EV=-13.3, and even the **free forecast** gets EV=-0.496 (already
    worse than climatology before any DA). Weak-4DVar gets finite, roughly ETKF/EnKF-scale
    per-window RMSE on 4/5 windows (NaN on the 5th) — not uniquely broken, same boat as the
    ensemble methods. Points to the pre-existing `qg_s1_qg1l_rscale_probe.py`/
    `generate_qg1l_report.py` (r-scale sweep) as the right lever, not further DA-side
    hyperparameter tuning.
  **Obs-protocol reproducibility validation (2026-09-06, `feature/qg-da-integration`,
  job 52174) — DONE, results hold:** the archived reference-case JSONs above were
  produced with the **pre-#156 constellation-style random-columns obs** (`(T, C·ny)`,
  simultaneous multi-column events); `data/qg.py` (PR #156) switched to per-column
  independent intra-day timing (`(T, ny)`). Re-ran all four methods at the exact
  reference settings (S0, c4, psi-obs, lag=1.0) under current `origin/master`:

  | method | archived (pre-#156) | current master (PR #156 geometry) |
  |---|---|---|
  | ETKF | 1.16 / 0.752 | 1.14 / 0.747 |
  | EnKF | 1.17 / 0.754 | 1.16 / 0.749 |
  | Strong-4DVar | 1.33 / 0.725 | **1.44 / 0.773** |
  | Weak-4DVar | 1.43 / 0.788 | **1.50 / 0.805** |

  Small shifts throughout, no qualitative change — if anything the conclusion
  strengthens: both 4DVar methods improved under the new geometry (Strong-4DVar now
  also beats ETKF/EnKF, not just Weak-4DVar), while ETKF/EnKF softened marginally.
  Archived JSONs are superseded by `reports/qg/outputs/qg_repro_validation/*.json`
  as the current reference numbers; the archived ones are kept for provenance only.
- **Report**: `reports/qg/generate_qg_s0s1_report.py` (JSON-only) renders from the result
  JSONs under `reports/qg/outputs/` → `reports/qg/outputs/qg_s0s1_report.md` (revised:
  governing equations, case-study table, S0 / S1-QG2L da_nx 16/32/64 / S1-QG1L sections,
  psi-obs focus). Dedicated `reports/qg/generate_qg1l_report.py` → `qg1l_report.md` for
  the reduced-gravity structural-error case (r-scale sweep).
- **Illustrations (S0 / S1-QG2L da_nx=32)**: `reports/qg/generate_qg_s0s1_figs.py` (no
  DA-cache dependency) runs a single-window production ETKF (nx=64, N=80, psi-obs,
  cols=4, 1% noise, lag 1.0) and writes per-scenario obs-days 2×2 panel + full-window
  obs Hovmöller, forcing, truth psi/q, analysis-vs-free-vs-truth, and a DA-cycle GIF to
  `reports/qg/outputs/figs/`. `generate_qg_s0s1_report.py` §8 embeds them
  (`![](figs/...)`, still JSON-only). The generator now (2026-09-03 fix) selects the
  **first window with a non-zero wind amplitude** (the S1 wind-levels list starts at
  0.0, so window 0 previously rendered a flat all-zero wind-curl forcing), draws the
  **corrupted** wind-curl (so the S1 figure shows the actual corrupted moving storm),
  fixes the DA-cycle GIF's per-panel `ax` handling (truth q₁ and DA-analysis q₁ panels
  were blank), and rebuilds the obs Hovmöller as a time×column storm-track field with
  cross-time interpolation (previously ~96% blank). Regenerated production figures
  committed alongside the fix. A follow-up DA-cycle obs-panel fix (2026-09-04) renders
  the **raw observations** (not a per-day aggregate): observed meridional columns are
  drawn **vertical** (removed the `img.T` transpose that had rotated them horizontal),
  at a single window-wide **fixed color scale** (previously re-normalized per frame),
  and each frame shows the nearest preceding raw obs event so the panel is never blank.
- **Tests**: 7 QG test files (`test_qg_dynamics`, `test_qg_data`, `test_qg_baselines`,
  `test_qg_s0s1`, `test_qg_random_columns`, `test_qg1l_dynamics`,
  `test_qg_psi_state`) — all in the master CI gate.
- **sbatch**: 32 `batch/run_qg_*.sbatch` for the S0/S1 matrix + S1-resolution + qg1l sweeps
  (+ `run_qg_figs.sbatch`, the illustration/DA-cycle regeneration job).
- QG is DA-baseline-only (no QG neural estimator; not wired into `train.py`/`get_dynamics()`).

### QG neural baseline (Q1/Q2) — infrastructure on `feature/qg-neural-baseline` (2026-09-06)

Self-contained DirectUNet / VanillaCFM(τ=0) neural estimators on the **S0**
case study, comparing against the QG DA baselines. Not wired into `train.py`
(dedicated entry point `train_qg_neural.py` + `data/qg_neural.py` wrapper).

- **Supervision**: daily mean of the full 2-layer **streamfunction** ψ
  (`psi_daily`), 30 days/window, with an auxiliary PV-q loss
  (`--q-loss-weight`, default 0.1) that inverts the ψ estimate to PV per-window
  (`norm_q_from_psi`) and MSEs it against the PV target. Tracked as both a ψ
  primary loss and a q auxiliary term per window.
- **Observations**: upper-layer ψ random-column obs, grid-expanded + daily
  aggregated + NaN-masked, padded to the full state width (zeros in the lower
  layer) so the shared `DirectUNet`/`VanillaCFM` (obs_dim==state_dim) work
  unchanged. `QGBatch.params` added (None) for the shared model forward paths.
- **Normalization (superseded 2026-09-08, see below):** the original design
  used `window_scales` (each window's own per-layer ψ/q std, `WindowScale`) so
  samples whose streamfunction energy spans a wide dynamic range (empirically
  ~30→10⁴ at nx=8 across windows) are each mapped to O(1), avoiding a single
  global scalar being dominated by the highest-energy windows. Q1 now uses
  **global** per-layer z-score normalization for ψ instead (see the
  "Global psi normalization" entry below) — `window_scales`/`WindowScale` are
  retained as a diagnostic only, no longer used to build training targets.
  **Critical (unchanged):** the ψ<->q inverter is cached per device
  (`_INVERTER_CACHE[..., device]`) so the GPU q-loss never moves the shared CPU
  inverter used by `psi_daily`/scales — which would otherwise break CPU-side
  eval after a GPU training step.
- **Model/lightning**: `QGNeuralLightning(pl.LightningModule)` computes
  DIRECTUNET `MSE(est, ψ_norm)` or τ=0 CFM `MSE(x0+v, (ψ_norm−x0))` plus the
  per-window q-loss; `create_trainer` for the Lightning loop.
- **Eval**: `estimate_windows` produces per-window physical ψ; `psi_to_q`
  maps to physical PV; both ψ and PV-q RMSE/EV per layer + pooled are written
  to `estimates_s0.npz` + `results.json` (`s0.psi`, `s0.q`).
- **Configs**: `config/experiment/Q1_direct_unet_s0.yaml`,
  `Q2_vanilla_cfm_s0.yaml` (documentation specs → CLI flags; not Hydra).
- **Report**: `reports/qg/generate_qg_neural_report.py` → `qg_neural_report.md`
  renders Q1/Q2 vs the 4 DA baselines (`qg_repro_validation`) on PV-q + ψ.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_qg_neural.py` (12 fast tests: psi-day matches the
  window's own upper-psi target, per-window scale O(1), dataset/collate shapes,
  denorm round-trip, `norm_q_from_psi` round-trip, per-device inverter-cache
  isolation, QGNeuralLightning fwd/bwd for both models, estimate_windows
  shapes) — added to the master CI gate.
- **HPC note**: per-window truth generation (`QGS01Dataset` spinup) is
  expensive (~85 s/window at nx=8 single-thread; nx=64 far more). The
  `num_train/val/test` defaults in the configs are a production target; see
  the "1000/100/100 train/val/test dataset generation" section below for the
  now-merged array-parallel/GPU-side generation infra that makes this
  tractable, and "Truth-only cache + on-the-fly obs" further below for how
  `train_qg_neural.py` consumes it.

### QG neural baseline — global psi normalization (2026-09-08)

Replaced the per-window ψ/q normalization (`WindowScale`) with **classic
global mean/std z-score normalization**, applied **only to ψ** (PV/q stays in
raw physical units), matching the L96 track's `data/normalization.py`
(`compute_channel_stats`/`normalize`/`denormalize`, added in #166) instead of
a QG-specific abstraction.

- **Precompute**: `precompute_qg_norm_stats.py` loads the 1000-window S0
  train truth cache and computes (a) global per-layer ψ (mean, std) via
  `data.normalization.compute_channel_stats`, (b) the per-window ψ std range
  (diagnostic, reuses `window_scales`) to check the dynamic-range concern
  documented above at production resolution, (c) the global pooled Var(q) and
  a derived `q_loss_weight = 1/Var(q)`. Run via
  `batch/run_qg_precompute_norm_stats.sbatch` (CPU-only, `--account=mee
  --qos=mee_short` on `Mee_Global_CPU` — the `odyssey` account's `low` QOS
  isn't permitted there) since loading the ~33GB train truth cache OOMs an
  interactive/unreserved shell. Output: `experiments/qg_psi_norm_stats.pt`
  (mean/std) + `..._extra.pt` (q_var/q_loss_weight/per-window std diagnostics).
- **Measured at nx=64, train-seed=42, 1000 windows (2026-09-07)**:
  `psi1 mean≈3.5e-6 std≈1.85e4`, `psi2 mean≈1.7e-6 std≈1.62e4`,
  `q_var≈3.93e-10` → `q_loss_weight≈2.5415e9`. Per-window ψ std range:
  layer1 min=3.9e3/max=9.19e4 (23.6x), layer2 min=1.0e3/max=8.6e4 (82.8x) —
  real but less extreme than the ~300x measured at nx=8; accepted trade-off
  (low-energy windows are under-weighted in the loss vs. the old per-window
  scheme, by up to ~16x at p10 energy) after review.
- **Why q stays raw + why q_loss_weight is ~1e9**: ψ std (~1e4) and q std
  (~1e-5) differ by ~9 orders of magnitude. Z-scoring only ψ makes
  `loss_psi` ~O(1) (unit target variance); `loss_q` in raw units would then be
  ~O(1e-10) and, at the old default `q_loss_weight=0.1`, contribute nothing
  (its gradient would be ~9 orders of magnitude too small to matter) — so the
  weight itself must absorb the scale gap. `q_loss_weight=1/Var(q)` is the
  balancing choice: it makes q's raw-unit MSE comparable in scale to ψ's
  (unit-variance) normalized MSE, and is derived/auditable rather than a
  hand-picked literal.
- **Config**: `training.q_loss_weight`/`data.normalize`/`data.norm_stats_path`
  in `config/experiment/Q{1,2}_..._s0.yaml` are now the actual source of truth
  (loaded via `OmegaConf.load` in `train_qg_neural.py`'s `main()`, CLI flags
  `--q-loss-weight`/`--normalize`/`--norm-stats-path` override); previously
  these YAMLs were documentation-only and `--q-loss-weight` had its own
  independently-hardcoded argparse default that could silently drift from
  them.
- **API**: `data/qg_neural.py`'s `QGNorm`/`compute_norm` (global, std-only,
  informational-only) are removed; `denorm_state`/`norm_q_from_psi` are
  renamed `denorm_psi`/`q_from_psi_norm` and take the `{"mean","std"}` dict
  from `data.normalization` instead of a per-window `WindowScale`. `QGBatch`
  drops its `scale` field (no longer needed — ψ normalization is a training-
  run constant, not a per-sample value, and q is unnormalized).

### 1000/100/100 train/val/test dataset generation (2026-09-07)

Scaling the S0/S1 truth-window generation from the ~5-200 window exploratory scale to a
**1000 train / 100 val / 100 test** window dataset exposed a critical perf bug and required
array-job parallelization to make the scale tractable.

- **Device-placement fix**: `QGS01Dataset._generate_truth` never moved its per-window
  `QGDynamics` to the requested device, so the ~2-year spin-up (the dominant cost, ~4.5
  min/window) ran on CPU regardless of GPU allocation. Fixed: `dyn`/`wind_full`/`traj_full`
  now roll out on the given `device`, then move back to CPU before the (CPU-only)
  obs/field-extraction post-processing. **7.4x speedup** measured on a dedicated A40:
  36.65s ± 0.16s/window (n=20) vs. the documented ~270s/window CPU baseline.
  `QGS01Dataset.__init__`/`make_qg_s0_s1_datasets` now accept an optional `device` param.
- **Per-window RNG independence**: `_generate_truth`'s param/geometry draws (`u/r/k/x0/y0/
  cx/cy`) used one `RandomState` shared sequentially across all `n` windows, so window `i`
  could only be generated after replaying windows `0..i-1`. Switched to a per-window
  `RandomState(cfg.seed + i)` (matching the already-index-keyed wind/traj/obs seed
  formulas) and added an `indices: list[int] | None` param so any subset of window indices
  can be generated independently, by any worker, in any order — required for array-job
  parallelization. Verified bit-identical to a full serial run over the same indices.
- **Array-parallel generation**: `reports/qg/generate_qg_window_chunk.py` (one chunk of
  window indices -> one `.pt` file per window) + `batch/run_qg_window_chunk_array.sbatch`
  (SLURM array task, `--gres=gpu:a40:1` — this cluster rejects untyped `gpu:1` GRES
  requests) + `reports/qg/assemble_qg_windows.py` (glob + sort by index -> single combined
  file at the exact `_truth_cache_path` the config/n/obs-geometry key expects, so
  `make_qg_s0_s1_datasets(..., cache_dir=...)` hits the cache afterward with no code
  changes downstream). Launched 3 array jobs (40+5+5 = 50 tasks, 25/20/20-window chunks)
  across the cluster's 3 idle A40 GPUs (this partition requires a specific GPU model, no
  generic request): **1200 windows generated in ~3h27min wall-clock** (23:43->03:10),
  150/150 tasks exit 0, no errors. Train-split assembly (1000 windows, ~32GB in memory)
  OOM'd under the interactive session's 16GB job-allocation cgroup cap; reran as its own
  sbatch job with `--mem=96G` (succeeded in 3m48s). Final cache: 32GB (train) + 3.2GB
  (val) + 3.2GB (test) = 38GB total, `reports/qg/outputs/qg_windows_1000_100_100/cache/`.
  End-to-end verified: `make_qg_s0_s1_datasets` cache-hit load (val, 100 windows) in 9.1s,
  correct S0/S1/S1-QG1L scenario shapes/metadata.
- Full QG suite (115 tests incl. 2 new: indices-subset reproducibility, device roundtrip)
  green.

### Test-split obs/IC correction + truth/obs/IC separation (2026-09-07)

The above generation used `QGConfig` defaults for `obs_geometry`/`cols_per_day`/
`obs_noise_std_frac`/`init_lag_days`, not the S0 reference-case settings
(`random_columns`/4/0.01/1.0) -- caught before running DA baselines on the test split.
Since truth generation doesn't depend on those fields, split `_generate_truth` into
`_generate_truth_only` (expensive rollout) + `_generate_obs_ic` (cheap: rebuilds a
`QGDynamics` from cached `true_params`, no rollout, redraws obs/init-state) --
`_generate_truth` now composes both, unchanged for existing callers.
`reports/qg/fix_qg_test_obs_ic.py` applies this to the test split in seconds, writing
`truth_only/test.pt`, `obs_ic/test_reference.pt`, and a corrected combined cache at the
hash `make_qg_s0_s1_datasets` expects. Train/val untouched (obs/IC for those are meant to
be generated on the fly downstream, not read from this cache). Added `--seed`/
`--cache-dir` to `run_qg_baselines.py` (seed was hardcoded to 7; no CLI path existed to
reach the pre-generated cache) so `run()`'s existing `ds=` bypass is reachable from the
command line.

**Bug caught by the test suite** during the `_generate_obs_ic` split: `init_lead_truth`
(cached, indices `[0, lead)`) doesn't include index `lead` itself (`traj[0]`), needed for
a zero-day lag draw -- fixed by concatenating `traj[:1]` before indexing. 115 tests green
after the fix.

**Separately found:** `run_qg_baselines.py` for a 100-window scenario OOM'd in this
interactive session's 16GB cgroup -- `run()` accumulates full per-window `(360, 8192)`
arrays across all windows before computing summary metrics (fine at ~5-window
exploratory scale, needs real memory at 100). Moved to `batch/
run_qg_test100_reference.sbatch` (`--mem=64G`, `--time=12:00:00`, ETKF/EnKF/
Strong-4DVar/Weak-4DVar at the exact S0 reference settings); results pending.

### Neural dataloader: on-the-fly obs for train/val (2026-09-07, `feature/qg-neural-baseline`)

Consumes the `_generate_truth_only`/`_generate_obs_ic` split above (unchanged
here) from the neural training side: `data.qg_neural.QGNeuralDataset(on_the_fly_obs=True)`
redraws obs/init-state fresh (random seed) from a truth-only window on every
`__getitem__` call, so train/val see a different obs realization each epoch
from the same cached truth instead of one fixed draw baked in — increasing
training obs diversity without re-paying the rollout. `data.qg.ensure_truth_only_cache`
(a lightweight single-process hash-keyed cache, distinct from the array-parallel
`generate_qg_window_chunk.py` pipeline above — useful for smaller-scale/smoke
runs; the production 1000-window cache from that pipeline
(`reports/qg/outputs/qg_windows_1000_100_100/cache/`) can also be pointed to
directly via `--cache-dir` once `train_qg_neural.py` is scaled up) wraps
`QGS01Dataset._generate_truth_only`, keyed only by the rollout-relevant
`QGConfig` fields so obs-geometry/noise tuning reuses the same cache.
`train_qg_neural.py` builds train/val from this + `on_the_fly_obs=True` by
default (`--fixed-split-obs` reverts to the old fixed-cache behavior); the
**test split is unchanged** (`ensure_truth_cache`, fixed reproducible obs).
`--num-test` default 200→100 (train/val defaults unchanged at 1000/100),
matching the 1000/100/100 split above. Note: `forcing` in `QGBatch` remains a
zero placeholder (Q1/Q2 are `cond_extra_dim=0`, obs-only) — on-the-fly
*forcing* conditioning was not wired, only obs; see CHANGELOG 2026-09-07 for
the full rationale/verification.

### Q1 launch: reusing the production 1000/100/100 nx=64 cache (2026-09-07, `feature/qg-neural-q1-launch`)

Wired `train_qg_neural.py` to reuse the already-generated production truth
cache (`reports/qg/outputs/qg_windows_1000_100_100/cache/`, 41GB, built by the
`generate_qg_window_chunk.py` array-job pipeline above) instead of paying the
~2-year-spinup rollout again from this branch:
- New `--train-seed`/`--val-seed`/`--test-seed` (default 42/10042/20042,
  matching `SPLIT_SEED_BASE`) and `--obs-geometry`/`--cols-per-day`/
  `--obs-noise-std-frac`/`--init-lag-days` (default `random_columns`/4/0.01/1.0,
  the S0 DA-baseline reference case) CLI flags, applied to `test_cfg` (which
  also seeds train/val's on-the-fly obs draws via the shared cfg object).
- Train/val now load via `ensure_truth_cache` (not `ensure_truth_only_cache`):
  the production cache's train/val entries already carry (QGConfig-default,
  i.e. wrong-for-S0) baked-in obs, but `on_the_fly_obs=True` overwrites
  `obs`/`obs_mask`/`init_state` on every `__getitem__` regardless, so reusing
  the full cache is correct and avoids a second, redundant cache format.
  `ensure_truth_only_cache` remains available/tested (`data/qg.py`) for
  contexts with no pre-existing full cache to reuse.
- **Bug found and fixed while validating this**: `build_cfg(...)` never set
  `num_windows`, leaving it at the `QGConfig` dataclass default (200) instead
  of the split size. Since `_truth_cache_path` hashes the *entire* `asdict(cfg)`
  (`num_windows` included) plus a separate `n_windows` key, this silently
  missed the production cache (whose entries were written with
  `num_windows` equal to the split size, matching
  `generate_qg_window_chunk.py`) and would have fallen back to a full
  from-scratch nx=64 rollout (~90h extrapolated) instead of a cache hit.
  Fixed by passing `num_windows=args.num_{train,val,test}` explicitly to each
  `build_cfg(...)` call. Caught interactively (stopped the hung process after
  ~5 min, well before real damage) by benchmarking `ensure_truth_cache`
  in isolation before trusting it inside a long GPU job — verified the fix by
  recomputing `_truth_cache_path` and diffing against the exact on-disk
  filenames (`qg_truth_a3c24de…`/`e7f84d…`/`ab5c09…` for train/val/test),
  then a live load (100-window test cache: 3.2s, was hanging past 90s before
  the fix).
- **On-the-fly obs cost at nx=64, benchmarked**: `QGS01Dataset._generate_obs_ic`
  (single window, no rollout) ≈32ms/draw → ≈1.8h aggregate over
  200 epochs × 1000 train windows, well hidden by GPU prefetch at
  `num_workers=1` (not a bottleneck).
- `batch/run_qg_q1_train.sbatch` (new): `Odyssey_GPU` partition, 1×A40,
  `--mem=96G` (must comfortably hold the 33GB train cache in RAM),
  `--time=24:00:00`, points `--cache-dir` at the production cache's absolute
  path (on the sibling `4dvarnet-fm-qg-100samples` worktree's filesystem
  location — the cache itself is untracked/gitignored, not portable via git).
- **Incidental environment fixes** (shared `fdv` conda env, unrelated to this
  branch's code): mid-session, a concurrent process modified the shared env
  twice — `setuptools` drifted to 84.0.0 (dropped the `pkg_resources` shim
  `pytorch_lightning` 2.3.3 needs; fixed with `pip install "setuptools<81"`),
  and separately `torch`'s `libtorch_global_deps.so` went briefly missing
  mid-reinstall (self-resolved after waiting; confirmed `torch 2.4.1+cu121`
  healthy after). Neither is caused by or specific to this branch's changes.

**Q1 status:** launched via `sbatch batch/run_qg_q1_train.sbatch` (job id
recorded in CHANGELOG 2026-09-07); monitor for completion before starting Q2.

## L96 (two-scale Lorenz-96) — merged to master 2026-08-18

- **Dynamics/DA baselines** (`feat/weighted-fast-coupling` merged into master, SW/MAOOAM excluded):
  - `models/lorenz96_dynamics.py`, `data/lorenz96.py` — two-scale L96 (NO=8, J=4, state_dim=40, weighted fast coupling)
  - `evaluation/run_l96*.py` + `reports/outputs/l96_baseline_report.md` — Waves 1-4 DA sweeps + ETKF ablation, pooled-EV metric
  - `models/dynamics.py` `get_dynamics()` supports only `lorenz63`/`lorenz96` (SW/MAOOAM deferred)
- **Training infrastructure** (built, no runs launched):
  - `conf/schema.py` → `DataConfig.to_lorenz96_config()`
  - `train.py` → `data.system` dispatch (`lorenz96`), `param_names`-generalized eval
  - configs: `config/experiment/L1_direct_unet_s0s1.yaml`, `L2_vanilla_cfm_s0s1.yaml`
  - test: `tests/test_lorenz96_training.py`

## L96 Neural Training (`feat/l96-neural-training`, from master @ 0687e07)

Implements all-5-param randomization + neural S0/S1 training (commit `3a1c8d5`).
See `L96_NEURAL_TRAINING_PROGRESS.md` for the per-WP tracker and handoff.

- **All 5 params randomized ±20%**: `models/lorenz96_dynamics.py` accepts `c1,h,hx,eps`
  + `F` kwargs; `data/lorenz96.py` `RandomParam`/`RandomBias` + `make_l96_s0_s1_trainval`.
- **Neural `param_dim=0` + `cond_extra_dim=0`** (DirectUNet, VanillaCFM-τ=0): obs-only
  input (no forcing/params conditioning; 24D in, 24D out).
- **DA parity**: `evaluation/run_l96.py` + `evaluate_all_l96.py` pass per-window all-5
  params to DA; S1 uses biased `*_da` params.
- Configs: `config/lorenz96_default.yaml`, `L1_direct_unet_s0s1.yaml`,
  `L2_vanilla_cfm_s0s1.yaml` (both `param_dim=0`; L2 is τ=0).
- Tests: `tests/test_lorenz96_training.py` (11 tests).
- sbatch: `run_one_epoch_tests_l96`, `run_l96_da_consistency`,
  `run_l96_neural_training`, `run_l96_evaluate_all`.

### Multi-agent review workflow (git/PR)

Code changes on this branch go through an implementer → reviewer → verifier loop.
Two execution paths:

- **Option A — GitHub PR**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs ruff + pytest on PRs
  to `feat/l96-*`. Agents use `gh pr create` / `gh pr review` / `gh pr merge`.
  Blocked until `gh auth login` is run interactively (W3).
- **Option B — Local**: `scripts/agent_review_loop.sh <STEP> "<desc>" [--review]`
  provides the same loop with local git (works immediately).

**Run-to-completion policy:** the general rules (branch naming, drive-to-merge, reviewer
identity, CI gate) live in `AGENTS.md` under **Git / PR Workflow** and apply to every
session — follow those. This branch additionally uses `feat/l96-*` as its integration
namespaces subject to the repo ruleset.

**REMINDER:** run `gh auth login` and enable branch protection on `feat/l96-*`
(require 1 PR approval + status checks) to unlock the GitHub PR path.

**Status (2026-08-24)**: Q1–Q3 closed; the canonical L96 benchmark artifact is
`reports/l96/outputs/l96_consolidated_benchmark.md` (all-metric tables RMSE/EV/ES ×
{all/slow/fast} + consistency checks + Hovmöller reconstruction examples, regenerated by
`reports/l96/generate_l96_consolidated_report.py`). Headline: neural beats the best DA
baseline on both S0 and S1 (RMSE 0.62 vs 0.74), degradation ≈1.00 vs DA ≈1.9×.
Note: tables use the **pooled** RMSE convention for every method (the DA cache stores
mean-of-per-window RMSE). ES note (**DA performance pending update**): a normalization
bug in `_ESAccumulator` (accuracy term divided by N twice) deflated cached EnKF/ETKF ES
to spread-dominated values, and separately `Strong4DVar.assimilate_batch` never computed
ES in-run (historical Strong values came from a since-deleted offline backfill). Fixes
merged to `feat/l96-neural-eval-fix`: PR #67 (accumulator formula + esfix infra),
#68 (batch-path Strong ES wiring + relative gate tolerance), #70 (dim-compatible truth
for reduced-dynamics S1 methods; #69 was an accidental empty merge).
**All DA ES values in the canonical s0c cache have been updated** (bug-fixed
accumulator, swapped 2026-08-24); RMSE/EV rankings are unaffected (fresh runs agree
within ~1%) and neural numbers are unaffected. The consolidated report now shows
proper ensemble ES for DA EnKF/ETKF (N=30) and L3 (ens30×10, N=30); deterministic
methods (Strong-4DVar, L1b/L2b/L4/L5/L6) show N=1 MAE ES (marked `*`). The remaining
legacy caches (s0c int200 fw, fw6 int100/int200, legacy int100/int200, dws50) were
**not** swapped: the original esfix array (49383) **failed** (ran against the pre-fix
`rerun_l96_esfix.py` without missing-`es` handling / strict 5e-3 tolerance). Their
regeneration is deferred — the `_ESAccumulator` fix needed to produce correct textbook
ES is now on master (PR #74), so resubmitting `batch/run_l96_esfix.sbatch` against
master and swapping the passing caches is open follow-up (see
"Deferred future work (Phases B & C)" → Phase C-adjacent DA regen note).

**Open questions (L96)** — all answered (standalone DA-parity eval, cached test set):
- **Q1 (REVISED 2026-08-24, L3 ens30 study — see below)**: the original answer
  (multi-τ worse than τ=0, +8.6%) was an artifact of single-sample × 1-step evaluation.
  With N=30 members and proper integration, multi-τ CFM **beats** conditional-mean
  estimation: L3 0.5643 vs τ=0 L2b 0.6290 (−10.4%), also beating DirectUNet L4
  (0.6189) — the new overall best on S0. Decomposition of the published L3 0.688:
  −5.5% from 30-member averaging (sampling variance), −13.2% further from 10 Euler
  steps (integration coarseness). τ=0 control is exactly invariant to n_outer
  (single-Euler-step shortcut), confirming the effect is specific to multi-τ.
- **Q1-original (superseded)**: multi-τ CFM does NOT beat conditional-mean estimation —
  L3 0.688/0.690 vs τ=0 L2b 0.633/0.633 (+8.6%); mirrors the L63 G-series finding
  **at 1 member × 1 step only**; see the ens30 revision above before quoting this.
- **Q2 (answered, L4/L5)**: size sensitivity is model-dependent — small DirectUNet
  (L4) slightly beats default L1b (0.619 vs 0.622); small τ=0 CFM (L5) is worse than
  default L2b (+4.3%). CFM benefits from capacity; DirectUNet does not. (Note: Q2's
  "best overall" ranking is superseded for S0 by L3 ens30×10 = 0.5643.)
- **Q3 (answered, L6)**: corrupted-forcing conditioning is neutral-to-slightly-negative
  (L6 0.639/0.638 vs obs-only L2b 0.633/0.633); neural degradation was already ≈1.00,
  so there was no robustness gap for conditioning to close.

### L3 ensemble study (`ens30`, S0 + S1, job arrays 49350 / 49447)

N=30 members to match DA EnKF/ETKF `N_ensemble=30`; outputs in
`experiments/{L3,L2b}_vanilla_cfm_s0s1/ens30_no{1,10}/` (`estimates_s0.npz` member mean,
`members_s0.npz` (200,3000,24,30) f32, `neural_eval.json` with a `sampling` block).
ES note: this S0 study ran while the DA `_ESAccumulator` still had its normalization bug,
so the S0 JSONs store both conventions ("cache" = legacy buggy `mae/M − 0.5·pairwise`,
"textbook" = proper scoring rule); after the 2026-08-24 fix there is a single ES
(the textbook formula) everywhere — the table below keeps both columns as record.
The S1 ens30 study (`experiments/L3_vanilla_cfm_s0s1/ens30_s1_no{1,10}/`, job 49447,
2026-08-24) ran against the bug-fixed code, so its JSONs store the single textbook
ensemble ES (matched by the DA EnKF/ETKF N=30 caches).

| Model | members × steps | RMSE | EV | ESens(cache)* | ESens(textbook) | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L3 multi-τ | 30 × 1 | 0.6503 | 0.845 | −0.094 | 0.336 | 0.194 |
| L3 multi-τ | 30 × 10 | **0.5643** | 0.879 | −0.140 | 0.265 | 0.278 |
| L2b τ=0 | 30 × 1 | 0.6290 | 0.854 | −0.021 | 0.371 | 0.062 |
| L2b τ=0 | 30 × 10 | 0.6290 (≡ no1 bitwise) | 0.854 | −0.021 | 0.371 | 0.062 |

(*legacy buggy convention, kept for provenance only.)

Reference points (single-sample): L3 0.688, L2b 0.633, L4 DirectUNet 0.6189;
best DA Strong-4DVar 0.742 (S1 1.432). Multi-τ spread (~0.28 at 10 steps) is ~4.5×
the τ=0 spread — the τ-sampled velocity field yields genuinely diverse members whose
mean beats every deterministic scheme; whether that diversity helps probabilistic
scores (CRPS vs the ES conventions here) is open follow-up work. The S1 ens30 study
is complete (2026-08-24, see below); other models' ensemble runs remain open follow-up.

### 5-seed reproducibility (S0, job array 49419)

Five independent 30-member ensembles (seeds 1–5) confirm the multi-τ advantage is
not a seed artifact. Report: `reports/l96/outputs/ens30_seed_report.md`.

| scheme | seeds 1-5 mean±std | seed0 (orig) | range (6 runs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-step (n_outer=1) | 0.6502 ± 0.0002 | 0.6503 | [0.6500, 0.6506] |
| 10-step (n_outer=10) | 0.5642 ± 0.0005 | 0.5643 | [0.5637, 0.5650] |

10-step/1-step ratio = 0.868 (−13.2%), cross-seed std < 0.001 for both schemes.
At inference τ is a deterministic schedule (k/N_outer), not random; all member
diversity comes from fresh x₀ noise. The improvement comes from proper ODE
integration of the multi-τ-trained field across τ∈(0,1], not from τ=0 evaluations
(the 1-step result at 0.650 is worse than the τ=0-trained L2b control at 0.629).

### L3 ens30 on S1 (job array 49447, 2026-08-24)

S1 counterpart of the S0 ens30 study, run against the bug-fixed single-ES code
(`--cases s1 --n-members 30 --seed 0`, n_outer ∈ {1,10}). Outputs in
`experiments/L3_vanilla_cfm_s0s1/ens30_s1_no{1,10}/` (`members_s1.npz` (200,3000,24,30) f32,
`estimates_s1.npz`, `neural_eval.json` with a single textbook `ensemble.es`).

| Model | members × steps | RMSE | EV | ES (ens, N=30) | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L3 multi-τ | 30 × 1 | 0.6528 | 0.843 | 0.338 | 0.194 |
| L3 multi-τ | 30 × 10 | **0.5667** | 0.877 | 0.267 | 0.278 |

The 10-step/1-step ratio is 0.868 (−13.2%) — the integration-coarseness effect is
statistically identical to S0. S1/S0 degradation at 30×10 is ≈ **1.004** (S1 0.5667 vs
S0 0.5643): the multi-τ ensemble is essentially as good on S1 as on S0, consistent
with the neural models' known robustness to the parameter-biased S1 test setup.

## Deferred future work (Phases B & C)

These were proposed alongside the S1 ens30 study (Phase A, done 2026-08-24) but are
**not committed for execution** — recorded so a future session can pick them up.

### Phase B — CFM architecture variants (low priority; **requires a design doc first**)

Investigate whether a Tweedie-style two-stage decomposition or a diffusion-style
variant improves on VanillaCFM for L96. **Design doc drafted 2026-08-25**
(`docs/phase_B_l96_cfm_variants.md`) — defines V1 (L96 TweedieSolver port,
obs-only, `use_energy=false`, 2-stage) and V2 (CFM + Tweedie residual hybrid)
precisely with reference bars vs L2b/L3/L4 and the open design questions to
resolve (cond_extra_dim plumbing, energy flag, stage-1 budget, 24D cell
validity, multi-member sampling, single-sample vs ens30×10 bar). **V3 diffusion
  deferred** (no scaffolding exists). **No Phase B code implements these yet** — a
  future session must resolve the doc's open questions before implementing.

**V2/V3 worktree state (checked 2026-08-28) — for the Phase B session:**
The V2/V3 topic worktree (`4dvarnet-fm-cfm-v2v3`, branch `feature/l96-v2v3-pure`)
is separate from master and **not yet trainable**:
- Its `train.py` still has **unresolved git merge-conflict markers** (B1 blocker;
  `py_compile` fails with `SyntaxError: unmatched ')'`) from commit `f7749a9`,
  so no training/eval can run from that branch as-is.
- It does **not** carry the vectorized data-gen fix merged to master as PR #105
  (`data/lorenz96.py` there has no `fast_generation` path). When the Phase B
  session resumes it should re-sync master first (which includes both #105 and the
  joint-DA work).
- The **parallel-merge CHANGELOG conflict** on master (joint-DA 2026-08-28 entry vs
  the V2/V3-sourced #105 2026-08-27 data-gen entry) is already **resolved cleanly**
  on `origin/master` — no markers remain. The V2/V3 tree did NOT contribute the
  fix to master (it merged independently); only its own branch needs the sync.


### Phase C — L96 joint state-parameter neural estimation (infra done 2026-08-25; training + eval done 2026-08-26)

Extend the existing **L63 joint infrastructure** to L96. Currently only L96 **Joint DA
baselines** exist; the L96 joint **neural** models were missing.
- **Existing (real) pieces:** `JointCFM` (`models/vanilla_cfm.py:75`, L63-shaped,
  `output_dim = state_dim + param_dim`); `JointCFMConfig` (`conf/schema.py:162`);
  L63 configs `H1_joint_cfm_default.yaml`, `H2_joint_cfm_tau0.yaml`, `S5/S6`; L96
  Joint DA baselines `JointEnKFL96`/`JointETKFL96`/`JointStrong4DVarL96`
  (`evaluation/baselines.py`) + `eval_joint_comparison_l96.py` (ready DA comparator).
- **Done (2026-08-25):** design doc `docs/phase_C_l96_joint_neural.md`; L96 joint
  neural models `JointCFM` (port) + `JointDirectUNet` (new); 3 configs L7/L8/L9;
  `data/lorenz96.py` flattens `fast_weights` to per-index `w1..w4`/`true_w1..`/`_da`
  scalar keys; `train.py`/`lightning_module.py` dispatch; `eval_joint_neural_l96.py`
  (extended `evaluation/neural_inference.py` for joint types); 8 joint-neural tests
  + WP1 dataset-key tests; 2 sbatch (training 3-task array, eval). `param_dim=8`,
  h fixed. Training completed; standalone eval + ens30 completed (2026-08-26, below).
- **Eval bugs fixed (2026-08-26):** PR #81 (`state_dim` inference, `obs_var_indices`,
  member-param collection), #83 (ens30 sbatch IFS, ensemble evaluator, `N_outer`
  passthrough), #85 (`collate_joint_eval` legacy-`fast_weights`-list support for the
  pre-flattening cached dataset), #89 (ens30 `params_pred` member-mean shape fix),
  #90 (report-generator table column-order/separator/best-marking fixes).
- **Results (2026-08-26, cached S0/S1 test set, Obs30, 200 windows):** see the L96
  joint neural benchmark at `reports/l96/outputs/l96_joint_neural_benchmark.md`.
  Single-sample: L7 0.606/0.662, L8 0.610/0.661, L9 0.626/0.631 (S0/S1 state RMSE).
  L9 ens30×10 is the best joint estimator (S0 **0.525**/S1 **0.531**), matching L3's
  multi-τ integration advantage. **L9 recovers the 8 params (paramRMSE 0.058) while L7
  τ=0 fails (1.21) despite matching state RMSE**; L8 deterministic recovers them well
  (0.061). **Joint ETKF DA baseline run (2026-08-28, Job 50577)** — see
  `l96_joint_da_benchmark.md`: S0 Joint-ETKF 0.633/param 0.053 (≈ L9 parity); S1 1.497/
  param 0.128 after the inflation/stability fix (see "L96 joint state-parameter DA
  baseline" under Experiments). **Joint-EnKF added 2026-08-28 (job 50655)** — the
  state-only-inflation fix was ported to `JointEnKFL96` (RC: it inflated the whole
  augmented state like the old ETKF, risking the same S1 divergence) and a joint
  `assimilate_batch` was added (the inherited parent batch silently dropped params);
  S0 0.726/param 0.057, S1 **1.459**/param 0.148 (S1 is the best DA row, stable after
  the fix). **Joint-Strong-4DVar run (2026-08-31, Job 51000)** — batched pure-gradient
  Adam solve (no LBFGS) over all 200 windows: S0 0.712/param 0.226, S1 **1.200**/param
  0.299. Joint-Strong-4DVar is now the **best DA row on S1** (beats Joint-EnKF 1.459 /
  Joint-ETKF 1.497 / vanilla Strong-4DVar 1.432) and close to Joint-ETKF on S0; its
  param recovery (esp. F 0.85) is weaker than the filters, but its S1 state skill is
  the joint-DA best.

### Phase C-adjacent (blocked, unblocks DA-parity ES): L96 DA cache ES regeneration

The original esfix array (job 49383 + resubmissions) failed before regenerating the
non-canonical baseline caches. A 2026-08-24 resubmission (job 49488, `--array=1-7`,
against fixed master) **still cannot complete**: it *resumed from the stale partial
`*_esfix*` caches* written by 49383 rather than doing a clean regeneration, and the
validation gate then **failed on 6 of 7 caches** (RMSE mismatch vs originals: e.g. dws50
EnKF S0 1.009→1.102, Strong-4DVar and S1 EnKF/ETKF drifting). Only the **legacy int100**
cache passes cleanly and was swapped (`.bak` + promoted esfix). Rather than force-swap
gate-failing caches (would corrupt RMSE consistency), the rest stay stale.

**Important scoping note:** the consolidated report's DA candidates
(`DA_JSON_CANDIDATES` in `reports/l96/generate_l96_consolidated_report.py`) point at the
**canonical s0c int100 fw** cache first, which was already swapped bug-fixed and is
correct (ETKF/EnKF proper textbook ES) — so **the report is already correct on the DA
side** and none of the 6 non-report caches affect it. The 6 remaining caches (s0c int200
fw, fw6 int100/int200, legacy int200, dws50, dws50 fw) serve other lineages and are
**not** referenced by the consolidated report. To finish them correctly, delete the stale
`*_esfix*` files for those caches and do a clean full regeneration (hours GPU each) —
outcome uncertain given the CHANGELOG's note that some L96 caches "are not reproducible
under current code semantics."

### Decoupled cascade (C1/C2) — documented negative (2026-09-01)

A **decoupled state→param cascade** (`model_type=param_head`, `models/param_head.py`) was
tested as an alternative to the coupled joint flow for recovering the 8 L96 params: a
`StateParamHead` reads obs + biased `*_da` params + forcing + a state estimate, trained
under two state sources — **C1** = frozen L1b state-only DirectUNet estimate, **C2** =
exact true state (ablation). **Both fail the fast weights `w1/w2` on S1 (NRMSE ≈ 1.1-1.2,**
i.e. relative error > 100%), even with the exact true state (C2) — an
**information/architecture bottleneck**, not a state-quality issue (F is partly state-quality:
true state halves it 1.67→0.86). Only the coupled **multi-τ flow (L9)** recovers all 8 params

**Standalone DA-parity results (cached test set, Obs30, 200 windows)** — S0/S1 RMSE
(single-sample convention; L3's S0 ranking is superseded by the ens30 study above):
L4 **0.619**/0.621 < L1b 0.622/0.625 < L2b 0.633/0.633 ≈ L6 0.639/0.638 < L5 0.660/0.660 < L3 0.688/0.690.
All neural degradation ≈ 1.00; best DA (Strong-4DVar): 0.742/1.432.

**L96 joint state-parameter estimation (Phase C, 2026-08-26)** — cached S0/S1, Obs30,
200 windows; 24D state + 8 params (F, c1, hx, eps, w1..w4). Single-sample S0/S1 state
RMSE: L7 0.606/0.662, L8 0.610/0.661, L9 0.626/0.631. Best joint = **L9 multi-τ at
ens30×10: S0 0.525 / S1 0.531** (matches L3's multi-τ integration advantage). Param
recovery is model-dependent: L9 recovers the 8 params (paramRMSE 0.058) as does L8
JointDirectUNet (0.061), but **L7 τ=0 fails to recover params (1.21)** despite matching
state RMSE. Full tables: `reports/l96/outputs/l96_joint_neural_benchmark.md`.

**L96 joint state-parameter DA baseline (2026-08-28, ETKF + EnKF)** — see
`reports/l96/outputs/l96_joint_da_benchmark.md`. Joint-ETKF vs vanilla ETKF, and
Joint-EnKF vs vanilla EnKF, on the cached S0/S1 set (200 windows). **S0** Joint-ETKF
state RMSE **0.633** (EV 0.82, ES 0.30) vs vanilla 0.878; paramRMSE mean **0.053** —
**at parity with the L9 neural model** (state 0.626 / param 0.059 single-sample).
Joint-EnKF S0 0.726 (EV 0.77, ES 0.37) beats vanilla EnKF 0.891 but is worse than
Joint-ETKF. **S1** Joint-EnKF **1.459** (EV 0.23, ES 0.84) is the best DA row, ahead of
Joint-ETKF 1.497 & vanilla EnKF 1.505 / ETKF 1.554 — both joint filters stabilized by
the state-only-inflation fix (RC: the filters were inflating the unobserved param
block, growing spread into the reduced J=2 forecast). Neural (L9) still clearly ahead
on S1 (0.631) via its ≈1.00 bias robustness. **Joint-Strong-4DVar run 2026-08-31**
(job 51000, batched Adam over 200 windows): S0 state RMSE **0.712** / S1 **1.200** —
beats vanilla Strong-4DVar (0.750/1.432) on both cases and is the **best DA row on S1**
(ahead of Joint-EnKF 1.459 / Joint-ETKF 1.497); param RMSE mean 0.226 (S0) / 0.299
(S1), weaker than the filters (F 0.85 dominates).

**Multi-method reconstruction artifacts (merged 2026-09-01, PR #134)** —
`eval_joint_comparison_l96.py` persists per-window reconstruction `.npz` arrays
(`trajectories`, per-member `ensemble_variance`, `params`, `es`) for every benchmarked
method, merged into `experiments/l96_joint_baselines_trajectories.npz`. Re-ran the 3
joint methods (jobs 51098/51131) + vanilla Strong-4DVar (51294, so it appears in the
comparator schema) on the canonical cached S0/S1 test set. `experiments/l96_joint_comparison.json`
is now the full **6-method** comparison (vanilla ETKF/EnKF/Strong-4DVar + Joint-ETKF/EnKF/
Strong-4DVar; fresh re-run values: Joint-ETKF S0 0.6348, Joint-EnKF 0.7244, Joint-Strong-4DVar
0.7054/1.1999). Both joint reports regenerate against it, so the neural report's DA-baselines
table now lists all 6 DA methods (incl. Joint-Strong-4DVar). Note the master committed DA
report retains oracle-free neural values; a stale local regeneration against oracle-era JSONs
on the master worktree was discarded in favor of the merged oracle-free content.

### S1 DA corrupted-forcing fix (2026-09-02) + slow-only obsj0 DA baselines

**S1 forcing bug fixed:** `cfg_s1` in both DA eval paths (`run_and_cache_baselines` and
`eval_joint_comparison_l96.py`) was built without `case=2`, so `Lorenz96Config.use_corrupted_forcing`
returned False and `evaluate_baseline` fed the DA the **true** forcing (`forcing_true`) on S1 —
the `forcing_state_bias=0.1` corruption designed into S1 was silently never applied to the DA
(the cached S1 windows *do* hold a genuine `forcing_corrupted`; it was just never read). Fixed by
setting `case=2` in `cfg_s1` (S0 unchanged). Re-ran the canonical obsj2 S1 DA (state-only + joint)
with the fix; **S1 changes only mildly** (filters <1%: Joint-ETKF 1.4976→1.5125, EnKF 1.5044→1.5123,
Strong-4DVar 1.4319→1.4369) — the DA is robust to the forcing corruption. **S0 reproduced within
noise** (S0 gate <2%), confirming the fix did not disturb S0. Canonical caches swapped (`.bak`
backups: `l96_baselines_dws500_s0c_*_obsj2_int100_fw.json*` + `l96_joint_comparison.json`); the
consolidated / joint-DA / joint-neural reports regenerated with the corrected S1 rows.

**New slow-only obsj0 configuration (2026-09-02):** decoupled the observation count from the S1
reduced-dynamics J and the eval metric group. Now `run_and_cache_baselines` / the comparator take
`obs_j` (fast vars observed; 0 = slow-only), `s1_j` (S1 reduced dynamics J, kept=2 for the obsj0
study), and `eval_j` (eval metric group, kept=2 → the same 24D slow+first-2-fast group) — all three
independent. This lets a **slow-only** observation (only the 8 slow X) be scored on the identical
24D eval subspace as the canonical obsj2 config, apples-to-apples. Ran state-only + joint DA
baselines (obsj0, Obs30, 200 windows): S0 EnKF 1.27 / ETKF 1.25 / Strong-4DVar 1.44 / Joint-ETKF
1.19; S1 EnKF 1.70 / ETKF 1.71 / Strong-4DVar 1.62 / Joint-ETKF 1.60. vs obsj2 the degradation is
dominated by the **unobserved** obs_fast group (S0 obs_fast ≈ 1.6–1.95 vs 0.88–1.10 obsj2) while the
**slow subgroup is preserved** (S0 slow ≈ 0.41–0.46). Joint-DA param recovery: S1 Joint-ETKF
0.130→0.158 (hx/F degrade), S0 slightly improves (0.045 vs 0.054, F-driven). Full tables:
